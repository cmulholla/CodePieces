# CodePieces
Bits of code I've made.

SQLgenerator.cpp:
 - I made this to generate ~25000 entries of test data for an SQL table.
 - This was for my database class final.

fractals3:
 - I used SFML for this (https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and the code creates images found in fractals3/fractals3/
 - This code creates mandelbrot images using julia sets based around the coordinates defines by the mandelbrot set.
 - This is not very well commented, as this was something I used to mess around with during my free time.

Python Machine Learning
 - As of now, this just includes a small side-project I did. I learned what I did through my intro to machine learning class.
 - This uses a k-means algorithm with sklearn fitted to data I found on https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities
 - The few images used from this algorithm are also found in this. I used the amount of countries in real life (~200) for this, as well as around 50 because it looks better.
