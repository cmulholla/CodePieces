# CodePieces
Bits of code I've made.

SQLgenerator.cpp:
 - I made this to generate ~25000 entries of test data for an SQL table.
 - This was for my database class final.

fractals3:
 - I used SFML for this (https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and the code creates images found in fractals3/fractals3/
 - This code creates mandelbrot images using julia sets based around the coordinates defines by the mandelbrot set.
 - This is not very well commented, as this was something I used to mess around with during my free time.

Python Machine Learning
 - As of now, this just includes a small side-project I did. I learned what I did through my intro to machine learning class.
 - This uses a k-means algorithm with sklearn fitted to data I found on https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities
 - The few images used from this algorithm are also found in this. I used the amount of countries in real life (~200) for this, as well as around 50 because it looks better.

anime listers
 - These four programs are split up into two manga programs and two anime programs:
 - datemangacalc.py finds the release dates of manga that have come out and extrapolates the data to find the next release
 - mangadownloader.py downloads manga off of the web (using a link you give it)
 - wcofunSublist.py finds recently released anime, or searches for anime and their ratings through google. This uses Selenium
 - websiteUpdater.py does what wcofunSublist.py does, but it only focuses on the html section of the program so I can easily update my website.
