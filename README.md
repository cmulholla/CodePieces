# CodePieces
Bits of code I've made.
SQLgenerator.cpp:
 - I made this to generate ~25000 entries of test data for an SQL table.
 - This was for my database class final.

Fractal3:
 - I used SFML for this (sfml.org) and the code creates images found in Fractal3/Fractal3/
 - This code creates mandelbrot images using julia sets based around the coordinates defines by the mandelbrot set.
 - This is not very well commented, as this was something I used to mess around with during my free time.
